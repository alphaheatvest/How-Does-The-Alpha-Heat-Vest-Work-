Before we dive into how it works, it’s important to understand what the Alpha Heat Vest is. The Alpha Heat Vest is a heated garment designed to keep you warm in cold weather conditions. Unlike traditional vests, which rely on thick insulation to trap body heat, the Alpha Heat Vest uses electric heating elements that are powered by a rechargeable battery. These heating elements are strategically placed in key areas of the vest to provide targeted warmth where it’s most needed, such as the chest, back, and abdomen. The result is a garment that not only keeps you insulated but actively generates heat to maintain your body temperature.
